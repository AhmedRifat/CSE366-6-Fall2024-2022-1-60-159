# Class Scheduling Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

This project implements a **class scheduling system** using a genetic algorithm for optimization and Pygame for visualization. It assigns classes to students based on preferences, availability, and class priorities, aiming to minimize conflicts and maximize efficiency.

## üéØ Project Overview

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Efficiently schedules classes to students by minimizing conflicts and considering student preferences.
- **Pygame Visualization**: Provides a real-time, interactive visualization of the scheduling process.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Assigns classes based on individual student preferences, availability, and class priorities.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Genetic Algorithm for Optimization
- **Fitness Function**: Designed to penalize schedules based on the number of conflicting classes and the inverse of student preferences.
  - **Conflict Penalty**: Increments for each class where the student is unavailable.
  - **Preference Penalty**: Adds the inverse of the student's preference for the assigned class.
- **Selection**: Retains the best-performing solutions based on fitness.
- **Crossover**: Combines parent schedules to create new offspring schedules.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random changes to offspring schedules to maintain diversity.

### 2. Pygame-Based Visualization
- **Grid Display**: Represents class assignments in a grid format.
  - **Rows**: Represent students.
  - **Columns**: Represent class slots.
- **Color-Coding**: Cells are color-coded based on slot durations and assignment status.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays the current generation, fitness values, and updates below the grid.

### 3. Dynamic Scheduling
- **Student Preferences**: Each student has a unique preference factor for classes.
- **Student Availability**: Randomly initialized availability for each class (1 = available, 0 = unavailable).
- **Class Priorities and Durations**: Each class has its own priority and duration.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```plaintext
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py             # Defines the Agent class for students
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.py       # Manages classes, preferences, availability, and grid visualization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.py               # Main script running the genetic algorithm and visualization
```

### `agent.py`
Defines the Agent class representing students.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for each student.
- `preference`: Preference factor of the student.
- `slots`: List of slots (classes) assigned to the student.

**Methods:**
- `assign_class()`: Assigns a class to the student.
- `total_time()`: Calculates total time required to complete all classes.
- `reset_classes()`: Clears assigned classes.

---

### `environment.py`
Manages the scheduling environment and visualization.

**Attributes:**
- `num_classes`: Number of classes.
- `num_students`: Number of students.
- `slot_durations`: Durations for each class slot.
- `class_priorities`: Priority levels for each class.

**Genetic Algorithm:**
- **Fitness Function**: Calculates penalties based on conflicts and preferences.
  ```python
  def fitness(individual):
      conflict_penalty = 0
      preference_penalty = 0.0

      for class_index, student_index in enumerate(individual):
          # Conflict Penalty
          if environment.student_availability[student_index, class_index] == 0:
              conflict_penalty += 1

          # Preference Penalty
          preference = environment.student_class_preferences[student_index, class_index]
          if preference == 0:
              preference_penalty += 1.0  # Maximum penalty
          else:
              preference_penalty += 1.0 / preference  # Inverse preference

      total_fitness = conflict_penalty + preference_penalty
      return total_fitness
  ```
  - **Conflict Penalty**: Counts the number of classes where the assigned student is unavailable.
  - **Preference Penalty**: Sum of the inverse of student preferences for the assigned classes.
- **Selection**: Selects top individuals based on fitness.
- **Crossover**: Combines parents to produce offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random mutations.

**Genetic Algorithm Parameters:**
- **Population Size**: 50
- **Mutation Rate**: 0.1
- **Number of Generations**: 100
- **Generation Delay**: 500 milliseconds (for visualization).

**Visualization:**
- Shows grid of class assignments.
- Displays generation and fitness information.
- Updates list of recent changes.

## üîÑ Customization

You can modify the scheduling parameters in `run.py`:

```python
# Environment setup
num_classes = 10      # Number of classes
num_students = 5      # Number of students

# Genetic Algorithm parameters
population_size = 50  # Size of the population
mutation_rate = 0.1   # Mutation rate
n_generations = 100   # Number of generations to run
generation_delay = 500  # Delay between generations in milliseconds
```
