# AI Grid Simulation: A* and UCS Algorithms

This project implements a grid-based simulation using two AI pathfinding algorithms: **A*** and **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)**. It simulates an agent navigating a grid to complete tasks while considering barriers that may obstruct its path.

## Features

- **A*** Algorithm:
  - Uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to find the optimal path to the nearest task.
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search):**
  - Finds the shortest path to the nearest task by considering the cost of each move.
- **Dynamic Task Completion:**
  - Tasks are dynamically generated on the grid, and the agent completes them by navigating around barriers.
- **Pygame Visualization:**
  - Visual feedback via Pygame that shows the grid, tasks, barriers, and the agent's movement (up, down, left, right).

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.6 or higher
- **Pygame**: For graphical display and user interaction

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the `run.py` file to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   
   This will open a Pygame window where the agent navigates the grid to complete tasks using either the A* or UCS algorithm. The algorithms can be triggered by clicking their respective buttons in the status panel.

## Key Components

### `agent.py`
- Defines the `Agent` class, which represents the agent navigating the grid.
- Implements methods for pathfinding using both A* and UCS.
- Handles task completion and cost tracking.
- Provides methods to move the agent along the path generated by each algorithm.

### `environment.py`
- Defines the `Environment` class, which manages the grid, tasks, and barriers.
- Generates random task locations and barriers.
- Ensures the agent's movement stays within the grid bounds and avoids barriers.

### `run.py`
- Sets up the Pygame window and controls the main simulation loop.
- Draws the grid, agent, tasks, barriers, and displays the current state and costs.
- Handles user interactions (button clicks to start A* or UCS simulations).
- Updates the agent’s movement and task completion in real-time.

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Grid Setup:**
   - A grid is created with random tasks and barriers placed within it.

2. **Agent Movement:**
   - The agent moves along the grid using the selected algorithm (A* or UCS).
   - The agent completes tasks by reaching the task locations.
   - Task completion is tracked, and the total cost of each path is displayed in real-time.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Two buttons, "A* Search" and "UCS Search," allow the user to start the simulation with the respective algorithm.
   - The agent moves automatically, and users can observe the completed tasks, total path cost, and agent’s position in the status panel.

## Customization

- You can modify the grid size, number of tasks, and barriers by editing the constants in the `run.py` file.
- The agent's behavior can be tweaked in `agent.py`, such as adjusting the pathfinding algorithms or task completion logic.
